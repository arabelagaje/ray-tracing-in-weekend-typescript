# Ray Tracing in a Weekend With TypeScript

This repository contains a TypeScript implementation of the "Ray Tracing in a Weekend". This is based on the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" by Peter Shirley, which provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of ray tracing.

## Overview

Ray tracing is a rendering technique that simulates the behavior of light to create realistic images. This project aims to guide you through the process of building a simple ray tracer from scratch using TypeScript. By following the book, you'll learn about concepts such as ray-sphere intersection, reflection, diffuse and specular lighting, and more.
